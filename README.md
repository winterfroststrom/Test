# Test

A simple RPG game demo.

This probably isn't the best way to structure a game with a lisp language, but rpg has a slightly customizable monsters and encounters. There is also an okay tile event system in place.

## Usage

To run, just do lein uberjar. Make sure the resources folder is in the same directory.

Feel free to use any part of my code in this for whatever.
